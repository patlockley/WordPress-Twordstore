== Description ==

Twordstore is a plugin designed to allow for user's tweets or twitter searches to be harvested and displayed via WordPress.

Using WordPress you can quickly set up a page on your site which will display either a user's tweets or a search across twitter.

Each tweet which is recorded can then also be displayed in any blog post or page on your site via shortcodes - a simple feature that this plugin makes very simple to use.
